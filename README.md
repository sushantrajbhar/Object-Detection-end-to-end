## Object Detection End-to-End Pipeline üöÄ

### Overview
This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end workflow for an object detection and image segmentation system. It includes building the necessary components from data ingestion, preprocessing, and model training, to deploying the final model as a web application.

---

### Project Structure üèóÔ∏è
The workflow follows a modular structure to maintain clarity and ease of development. The core components of the project are:

- **Constants**: Store all constants and configuration values used across the project.
- **Entity**: Define structured entities used for passing data between components.
- **Artifact Entity**: Responsible for managing the artifact outputs from each component.
- **Components**: Core logic for various stages of the object detection pipeline:
  - Data Ingestion
  - Data Preprocessing
  - Model Training
  - Model Evaluation
- **Pipeline**: The orchestration of all components in a sequential flow.
- **Endpoint**: A web-based interface to interact with the model using Flask (`app.py`).

### Setup and Installation ‚öôÔ∏è
To run the project on your local machine, follow the steps below:

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**
   ```bash
   virtualenv object_detection_venv


2.  **Activate the Environment**
   
cd object_detection_venv
Scripts\activate

4. **Install Required Dependencies**

pip install -r requirements.txt

6.** Run the Application**
python app.py


## Key Features ‚ú®
- **Modular Design**: The project is designed to be highly modular, with each component handling a distinct part of the workflow.
- **End-to-End Pipeline**: From raw data ingestion to serving predictions, every step is automated and reusable.
- **Extensibility**: You can easily extend or modify any part of the pipeline, including swapping out the object detection model.
- **Web Interface**: The project is served through a Flask app, allowing users to interact with the model via an intuitive web interface.

## Technology Stack üõ†Ô∏è
- **Python**: The core language used for all components.
- **Flask**: Used for building the web interface.
- **YOLOv9**: For state-of-the-art object detection and image segmentation.
- **Virtualenv**: To manage project dependencies in an isolated environment.

## Dataset üìä
I have used the dataset located at [this link](https://universe.roboflow.com/lamar-university-venef/grocery-rfn8l). It is a comprehensive dataset which has around 23k images. The training is done on Kaggle GPU, and you can check the code in the notebook present in the `yolov9/training_notebook` folder.
